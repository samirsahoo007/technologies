# How to get the API Token for Jenkins

Since Jenkins 2.129 the API token configuration has changed:
You can now have multiple tokens and name them. They can be revoked individually.

* Log in to Jenkins.

* Click you name (upper-right corner).

* Click Configure (left-side menu).

* Use "Add new Token" button to generate a new one then name it.

* You must copy the token when you generate it as you cannot view the token afterwards.

* Revoke old tokens when no longer needed.
