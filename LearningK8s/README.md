Docker Container Orchestration Using Kubernetes
In a Docker cluster environment, there are lot of task need to manage like scheduling, communication, and scalability and these tasks can be taken care by any of the orchestration tools available in market but some of the industry recognized tools are Docker Swarm which is a Docker native orchestration tool and "Kubernetes" which is one of the highest velocity projects in open source history.

Kubernetes is an open-source container management (orchestration) tool. Itâ€™s container management responsibilities include container deployment, scaling, and descaling of containers and container load balancing. There are Cloud-based Kubernetes services called as KaaS (Kubenetes as a Service ) also available namely AWS ECS, EKS, Azure AKS, and GCP GKE.
