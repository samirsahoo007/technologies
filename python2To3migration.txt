Python3 for mac-os

Download version Python 3.6.3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ 5 and install

Once you install python3 check for the python3 path

which python3

/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3

which pip3

/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/pip3

Upgrade your pip3 if required. (optional)
pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org pip setuptools

Now you can start installing any packages you need by typing
pip3 install

5. Pycharm setup:

Click on Preferences—>Project—>Project Interpreter—>select project——>select your python version from dropdow n. (you already should have the python3 path)

To convert a code base from python2 to python3 you can use a tool called 2to3 (default in OSX 10.14.6 and above)
which 2to3

/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/2to3

The above tool will do basic conversion. any complex packages/dependancies needs to be resolved manually
